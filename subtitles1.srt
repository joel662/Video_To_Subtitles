1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So you've got GitHub Copilot, congrats.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Copilot can help you level up your skills as a developer

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in ways that you probably thought were not possible,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
seriously, but now that you've got it, where do you start?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How does it work?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do you need to learn?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're gonna answer all of that in this video.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I think you'll find that once you know how and where

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to use Copilot, it is pretty simple to dramatically increase

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
your speed and productivity almost immediately.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The secret of GitHub Copilot is that there isn't anything

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
special that you need to do to learn how to interact with it.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All you have to do to use GitHub Copilot is code.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's it.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just code like you normally would and watch the AI go to work.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is called ghost text, and it's automatically turned on

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
when you install the extension and log in to GitHub Copilot.

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can verify that Copilot is active by checking

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
for the GitHub Copilot icon down here in your status bar.

20
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And if you wanna turn Copilot off for a specific file

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
or language, click on this icon and you can disable it.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can also trigger ghost text by writing a comment

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
expressing what you want.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To accept a ghost text completion, press Tab.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you only want part of the ghost text,

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
you can just hold down the controller command keys

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and press the right arrow to accept as much or little

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
of it as you want.

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And you can hit Escape at any time to dismiss the ghost text.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can do a lot with just ghost text,

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and you'll find that Copilot is remarkably good

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
at anticipating your next move

33
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and doing a lot of the work for you.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For example, if I create a variable called nums,

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Copilot gives me what I probably want based on the name

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
of the variable and the function in the file already,

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
an array of numbers.

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And if I press Enter below the function,

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it assumes that I wanna call the function

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
and pass in the nums variable, which is exactly what I want.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now ghost text may give you what you want,

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
or it may be a close and almost, but amiss.

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In that case, you can see some alternative suggestions

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
by pressing the control or command and Enter keys.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This opens up a side panel

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
where you can see more suggestions from the AI

47
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that you might like better.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The other way that you can use GitHub Copilot

49
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
right in your code is to chat with it directly,

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
right here, using something that's called inline chat.

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This can be triggered with the control or command and I keys.

52
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
None of this code actually exists in your file

53
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
until you accept it.

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So if you hit escape, it will all just go away,

55
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
no harm, no foul.

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Inline chat is great for iterating on your code

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
right in line.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So for instance here,

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
perhaps we wanna return a static file at this route

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
instead of what Copilot gave us,

61
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
so we can highlight the block

62
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and iterate on that with inline chat.

63
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And inline chat always gives you a diff view,

64
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
showing you what's been added and changed

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
so that you can be sure that this is what you want

66
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
before you accept it.

67
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
GitHub Copilot also features

68
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
a more traditional dedicated chat area in the sidebar

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
that you can access by clicking on the chat icon.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you've ever used another AI chat before,

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
this will feel very familiar.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
While ghost text inline chat

73
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
are good for helping you code faster,

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
chat is good for helping you solve problems

75
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and make decisions quicker.

76
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It is terrific for brainstorming

77
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and figuring out implementation details.

78
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can always customize where the chat appears

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
in your editor.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So for instance, if you'd like to see your code

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and your project files in the chat all at the same time,

82
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you can click on the secondary sidebar icon

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and just drag the chat into that sidebar.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All of your chats are saved to a history

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
that you can access at any time

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
with the history icon at the top of the chat.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There are a few other places

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
that you'll find GitHub Copilot

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and it can be quite useful.

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
One of them is when you have a problem in your code,

91
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you'll find GitHub Copilot here in the light bulb

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
or quick suggestion menu,

93
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
where it can explain

94
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and often even fix your errors right in line.

95
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Copilot is extremely good at fixing silly mistakes

96
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and explaining compiler errors that otherwise make no sense.

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You'll also find GitHub Copilot

98
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
anywhere that you see this sparkle icon.

99
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This includes places like the terminal

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
and anywhere that GitHub Copilot

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
might be able to help you out.

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All you have to do is keep your eye out for the sparkle

103
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and when you see it, give it a click

104
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and see what Copilot can do for you right then and there.

105
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And believe it or not, that's it.

106
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You now know the essentials

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
of how to interact with GitHub Copilot.

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Go forth and see how much better life can be

109
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
as a developer.

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And make sure you check out our other videos

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000

112
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Happy coding.
