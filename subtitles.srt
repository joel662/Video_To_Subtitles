1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
So you've got GitHub Copilot, congrats.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Copilot can help you level up your skills as a developer

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
in ways that you probably thought were not possible,

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
seriously, but now that you've got it, where do you start?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How does it work?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What do you need to learn?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
We're gonna answer all of that in this video.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And I think you'll find that once you know how and where

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
to use Copilot, it is pretty simple to dramatically increase

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
your speed and productivity almost immediately.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The secret of GitHub Copilot is that there isn't anything

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
special that you need to do to learn how to interact with it.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All you have to do to use GitHub Copilot is code.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That's it.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Just code like you normally would

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
and watch the AI go to work.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This is called ghost text, and it's automatically turned on

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
when you install the extension and log in to GitHub Copilot.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can verify that Copilot is active by checking

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
for the GitHub Copilot icon down here in your status bar.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
And if you want to turn Copilot off for a specific file or language,

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
click on this icon and you can disable it.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can also trigger ghost text by writing a comment

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
expressing what you want.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To accept a ghost text completion, press Tab.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you only want part of the ghost text,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
you can just hold down the controller command keys

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
and press the right arrow to accept as much or little of it

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
as you want.

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And you can hit Escape at any time to dismiss the ghost text.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You can do a lot with just ghost text,

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and you'll find that Copilot is remarkably good

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
at anticipating your next move and doing a lot of the work for you.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For example, if I create a variable called nums,

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Copilot gives me what I probably want based on the name of the variable

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and the function in the file already, an array of numbers.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And if I press Enter below the function,

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
it assumes that I want to call the function

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and pass in the nums variable, which is exactly what I want.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, ghost text may give you what you want,

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
or it may be close and almost, but amiss.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In that case, you can see some alternative suggestions

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
by pressing the Control or Command and Enter keys.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This opens up a side panel where you

45
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
can see more suggestions from the AI

46
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
that you might like better.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The other way that you can use GitHub Copilot right in your code

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
is to chat with it directly, right here, using something

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that's called inline chat.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This can be triggered with the Control or Command and I keys.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
None of this code actually exists in your file

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
until you accept it.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So if you hit Escape, it will all just go away, no harm, no foul.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Inline chat is great for iterating on your code right in line.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
So for instance, here, perhaps we

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
want to return a static file at this route instead

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
of what Copilot gave us, so we can highlight the block

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
and iterate on that with inline chat.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And inline chat always gives you a diff view,

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
showing you what's been added and changed.

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
So that you can be sure that this is what you want

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
before you accept it.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
GitHub Copilot also features a more traditional dedicated chat

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
area in the sidebar that you can access

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
by clicking on the chat icon.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you've ever used another AI chat before,

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
this will feel very familiar.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
While ghost text inline chat are good for helping you code faster,

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
chat is good for helping you solve problems

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
and make decisions quicker.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It is terrific for brainstorming and figuring out

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
implementation details.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can always customize where the chat appears

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
in your editor.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
So for instance, if you'd like to see your code

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
and your project files in the chat all at the same time,

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
you can click on the secondary sidebar icon

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
and just drag the chat into that sidebar.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All of your chats are saved to a history

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
that you can access at any time with the history icon

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
at the top of the chat.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There are a few other places that you'll find GitHub Copilot,

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and it can be quite useful.

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
One of them is when you have a problem in your code,

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
you'll find GitHub Copilot here in the light bulb

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
or quick suggestion menu, where it can explain

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and often even fix your errors right in line.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Copilot is extremely good at fixing silly mistakes

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and explaining compiler errors that otherwise make no sense.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You'll also find GitHub Copilot anywhere

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
that you see this sparkle icon.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This includes places like the terminal

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and anywhere that GitHub Copilot might be able to help you out.

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
All you have to do is keep your eye out for the sparkle

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and when you see it, give it a click

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and see what Copilot can do for you right then and there.

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
And believe it or not, that's it.

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You now know the essentials of how to interact

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
with GitHub Copilot.

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Go forth and see how much better life can be as a developer.

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And make sure you check out our other videos

102
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
on GitHub Copilot for all your AI coding needs.

103
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Happy coding.
