1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,320
so you've got GitHub co-pilot congrats

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,200
co-pilot can help you level up your

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,080
skills as a developer in ways that you

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,440
probably thought were not possible

5
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,719
seriously but now that you've got it

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:13,599
where do you start how does it work what

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,160
do you need to learn we're going to

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,760
answer all of that in this video and I

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,439
think you'll find that once you know how

10
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,760
and where to use co-pilot it is pretty

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,279
simple to dramatically increase your

12
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:26,000
speed and productivity almost

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,840
immediately The Secret of GitHub

14
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,039
co-pilot is that there isn't anything

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,279
special that you need to do to learn how

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:34,320
to interact with it all you have to do

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,200
to use GitHub co-pilot is code that's it

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,360
just code like you normally would and

19
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,200
watch the AI go to work this is called

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,879
ghost text and it's automatically turned

21
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,960
on when you install the extension and

22
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,039
log in to GitHub co-pilot you can verify

23
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,680
that co-pilot is active by checking for

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,520
the GitHub co-pilot icon down here in

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,760
your status bar and if you want to turn

26
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:01,320
co-pilot off for a specific file or

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,879
language click on this icon and you can

28
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:05,880
disable it you can also trigger ghost

29
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,000
text by writing a comment expressing

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
what you want to accept a ghost text

31
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,960
completion press tab if you only want

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,920
part of the ghost text you can just hold

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,040
down the controller command keys and

34
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,280
press the right arrow to accept as much

35
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,799
or little of it as you want and you can

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,479
hit Escape at any time to dismiss the

37
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:27,680
ghost text you can do a lot with just

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,640
ghost text and you'll find that co-pilot

39
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,600
is remarkably good at anticipating your

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,720
next move and doing a lot of the work

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,360
for you for example if I create a

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,000
variable called nums co-pilot gives me

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,759
what I probably want based on the name

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,560
of the variable and the function in the

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,520
file already an array of numbers and if

46
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,840
I press in or below the function it

47
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,960
assumes that I want to call the function

48
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,840
and pass in the nums variable which is

49
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,079
exactly what I want now ghost text may

50
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,920
give you what you want or it may be a

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,159
close and almost but a Miss in that that

52
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,119
case you can see some alternative

53
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,439
Suggestions by pressing the control or

54
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,360
command and inner keys this opens up a

55
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,318
side panel where you can see more

56
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:11,680
suggestions from the AI that you might

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,920
like better the other way that you can

58
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,480
use GitHub co-pilot right in your code

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,480
is to chat with it directly right here

60
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,800
using something that's called inline

61
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,040
chat this can be triggered with the

62
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,280
control or command and I Keys none of

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,200
this code actually exists in your file

64
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,160
until you accept it so if you hit Escape

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,680
it will all just go away no harm no foul

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,080
inl chat is great for iterating on your

67
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,319
code right in line so for instance here

68
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,879
perhaps we want to return a static file

69
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:43,680
at this route instead of what co-pilot

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,000
gave us so we can highlight the block

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,440
and iterate on that with inline chat and

72
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,640
inline chat always gives you a diff view

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,200
showing you what's been added and

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,720
changed so that you can be sure that

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,319
this is what you want before you accept

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,080
it GitHub co-pilot also features a more

77
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,280
traditional dedicated chat area in the

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
sidebar that you can access by clicking

79
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,959
on the chat icon if you've ever used

80
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:08,319
another AI chat before this will feel

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,519
very familiar while ghost text and

82
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:12,239
inlight chat are good for helping you

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,200
code faster chat is good for helping you

84
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,239
solve problems and make decisions

85
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:20,080
quicker it is terrific for brainstorming

86
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,760
and figuring out implementation details

87
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,400
you can always customize where the chat

88
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,799
appears in your editor so for instance

89
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,439
if you'd like to see your code and your

90
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:30,200
project files in the chat all at the

91
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,480
same time you can click on the secondary

92
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
sidebar icon and just drag the chat into

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,840
that sidebar all of your chats are saved

94
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,840
to a history that you can access at any

95
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,280
time with the history icon at the top of

96
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,840
the chat there are a few other places

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,599
that you'll find GitHub co-pilot and it

98
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:49,080
can be quite useful one of them is when

99
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,040
you have a problem in your code you'll

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,400
find GitHub co-pilot here in the light

101
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,959
bulb or quick suggestion menu where it

102
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:58,680
can explain and often even fix your

103
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,480
errors right in line co-pilot is

104
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,360
extremely good at fixing silly mistakes

105
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,239
and explaining compiler errors that

106
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:08,959
otherwise make no sense you'll also find

107
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
GitHub co-pilot anywhere that you see

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,720
this sparkle icon this includes places

109
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,079
like the terminal and anywhere that

110
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,000
GitHub co-pilot might be able to help

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,199
you out all you have to do is keep your

112
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:22,240
eye out for the Sparkle and when you see

00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,840
it give it a click and see what copilot

114
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,680
can do for you right then and there and

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,800
believe it or not that's it you now know

116
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
the essentials of how to interact with

117
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,120
GitHub co-pilot go forth and see how

118
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,039
much better life can be as a developer

119
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:39,160
and make sure you check out our other
