00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Copilot serves to advance your programming skills as a developer.

Or, alternatively:

   Copilot is designed to enhance your developmental skills as a programmer.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
In methods you likely considered impossible, this was achieved.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Indeed, now that you possess it, where should one begin?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
How does this function? or How is it operated? (These both convey the same intent as the original but with slightly different phrasing.)

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What specific knowledge or skills are you seeking to acquire?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In this video, we will address all those questions.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I believe you will discover that after learning how and where, [you/it] will find it.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
To utilize Copilot, it's incredibly straightforward to significantly enhance your performance.

Alternatively:
For using Copilot, it's extremely easy to make a substantial improvement.

Or:
With Copilot, it's quite effortless to achieve a considerable enhancement.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Boosts your speed and productivity swiftly.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The secret behind GitHub Copilot lies in the absence of anything specific.

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Specific steps required for effective interaction with it.

or

   Steps necessary for learning how to engage with it.

or

   Essential methods to grasp how to connect with it.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
To utilize GitHub Copilot, simply code.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That concludes it.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Code as Usual

Or

Code in Your Regular Manner

(The original text was a bit unclear because "just" implies a casual or simplified action, but coding isn't typically thought of as an easy or simple task, so the new versions emphasize that the instructions are to code as one would usually do.)

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Observe as AI gets to task.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This text is referred to as "ghost text," which is activated by default. (Or) This appears to be "ghost text"; it's set to auto-activate.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Upon extension installation and logging into GitHub Copilot.

Here's another option for a more concise version:

Install the extension and then log in to GitHub Copilot.

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You can confirm that Copilot is operational by verifying its status.

   or

   To ensure Copilot is functioning, check its status.

   or (informal)

   Make sure Copilot's on? Check its status to be sure.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
For the GitHub Copilot icon located within your status bar, please refer to it here.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
To deactivate Copilot for a particular file or language:

Or, alternatively:

If you wish to disable Copilot for a specific file or language.

Both versions convey the same meaning and have improved clarity and grammar compared to the original.

22
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Click on this icon to deactivate it.

Or if you prefer a more concise version:

Click icon to disable.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You can also instigate ghost text by posting a comment (improved grammar and simplified sentence structure)

24
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Requesting What You Desire

or

Expressing Your Preferences

or

Communicating Your Wants

or

Articulating Your Needs

Each of these options keeps the main idea, "expressing" or "communicating," while improving the clarity and grammar. They also focus on the concept of wanting or needing something, which seems to be the intention behind the original text.

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
To confirm a ghost text entry, press 'Tab'.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
If you desire a specific portion of the ghost text alone, please specify it.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You may simply keep holding down the designated command keys on the controller.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Press the right arrow key to either accept a large or small amount of it.

or

Press the right arrow button to either fully accept or partially accept it.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
As desired. (Keeping the original intent unchanged.)

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
You can press Esc key anytime to close the ghost text. (Alternatively, dismiss the ghost text.)

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
"Perform multiple tasks using merely phantom text" or "Achieve much with only the use of ghost text" (both maintain the original meaning but improve readability and clarity)

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
1. Discover for yourself that Copilot is exceptionally competent.
2. Uncover the fact that Copilot is quite impressive.
3. You will realize that Copilot is truly remarkable.
4. It will become evident to you that Copilot performs exceptionally well.
5. Observe for yourself that Copilot is surprisingly proficient.
6. Witness firsthand the high level of competence displayed by Copilot.
7. Experience personally the greatness of Copilot's abilities.

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Anticipating your next action and handling much of the tasks for you.

34
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
For instance, when I define a variable named "nums"

Alternatively:

   For example, I name a variable as "nums"

   As an illustration, I label a variable "nums"

   To give an example, I call my variable "nums"

   For demonstration purposes, I label the variable as "nums"

   In order to provide an example, I designate the variable as "nums"

Each of these variations maintains the original meaning while improving the clarity and grammar.

35
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Copilot Provides Me with What Seems Desired According to the Name of the Variable

or

Copilot Delivers What Appears Desired Based on the Named Variable's Designation

or (for a more informal tone)

Copilot Gives Me What I Seem to Want, Based on Variable Name

or (for a shorter version)

Copilot - Variable-Based Selection

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
1. The function within the file currently operates on an array of numbers.

Alternatively:

2. In the present state, the function handles an array of numbers within the file.

Or for a more concise version:

3. Function in file deals with an array of numbers.

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
1. If I press "Enter" under the defined function, it will execute the code within that function.
2. When "Enter" is pressed beneath the function definition, the code contained therein will be executed.
3. Pressing "Enter" below the function causes the enclosed code to run.
4. Upon pressing "Enter" below a function, the code inside the function will be invoked.
5. Depressing "Enter" under a function leads to the execution of the function's contained code.

38
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It supposes that I intend to invoke the function. (or) It supposes my intention is to execute the function. (or) It postulates that I wish to trigger the function.

39
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
1. Assign the "nums" variable as expected.
   2. The "nums" variable should be input as intended.
   3. Please input the "nums" variable as specified.
   4. Ensure that the "nums" variable is passed in.
   5. Passing the correct "nums" variable is crucial.
   6. I need you to pass the "nums" variable correctly.
   7. Kindly input the "nums" variable as requested.
   8. The "nums" variable must be handed over.
   9. I require that the "nums" variable be passed in.
  10. To meet my requirements, pass the "nums" variable.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now, the Ghost Text may grant your wishes. (This version aims to improve clarity while maintaining the original intent.)

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It might be near and nearly correct, yet still not quite accurate.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
In such a scenario, several possible alternatives may be viewed.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Press the 'Control' or 'Command' key along with the 'Enter' key.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
This displays a side panel for your interaction.

5. Further Method for Activating GitHub Copilot Directly in Your Coding Environment

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
To communicate with it directly, here, by making use of something (platform/tool)

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
That is referred to as Inline Chat.

50
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
This action can be initiated using the 'Control' or 'Command' key in combination with the 'I' key.

51
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The given code does not appear in your current file.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Until you acknowledge it. (or Until you agree with it.)

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
If you press the Escape key, everything will disappear with no damage or blame involved.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Inline chat facilitates efficient code iteration directly within it.

55
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
For example, in this case, let us consider the possibility of

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Desire to Serve a Static File at This Particular Route Instead

(or alternatively)

Intend to Deliver a Static File Via This Specific Route Instead

(or also)

Preference for Sending a Static File Along This Designated Route Instead

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
From what Copilot provided, let us emphasize the section.

or alternatively:

With the data that Copilot shared, let us focus on this segment.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
1. Revise and refine this further using real-time conversation (inline chat).

or

  2. Continue to develop and enhance this, employing in-line discussion for feedback.

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Inline chat offers a distinct perspective at all times.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Initially: "New features we've added in this release"

Improved version: "Features Added in This Release (Highlights)"

Initially: "Bug fixes and improvements for existing features"

Improved version: "Bug Fixes and Enhancements to Existing Features"

Initially: "Introducing our new partnership with Acme Corp."

Improved version: "Announcing Our New Partnership with Acme Corporation"

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
To ensure this aligns with your expectations.

Or more concisely:
For confirmation that this matches your desires.

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Before your acceptance, consider it.

63
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
GitHub Copilot additionally offers a conventional dedicated chat interface.

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sidebar section accessible to you

or

Accessible sidebar section

Both options convey the same meaning as the original text but are clearer and grammatically correct. The first option emphasizes that it is a specific area within the sidebar, while the second option highlights that the sidebar itself can be accessed (which was slightly implied in the original text).

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
1. To click on the chat icon.
2. Click on the icon for chat.
3. Accessing chat via the icon click.

6. Initiate chat with a click on the icon.
7. To start a conversation, click the chat icon.
8. Click the icon for initiating chat.
9. Commence your chat by clicking the icon.
10. Interact through the chat icon by clicking.

66
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
If you have previously utilized another artificial intelligence chat service,

67
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This will seem extraordinarily familiar.

68
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
While in-line ghost text within chat systems can aid in coding more swiftly, it also poses certain challenges.

In this revised version, I have kept the original idea but added a sentence to address potential difficulties that may arise with using in-line ghost text in chat systems while coding.

69
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Chat assists in resolving issues effectively

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Make decisions more swiftly.

Here are some options for improved clarity:

1.   Streamline your decision-making process.
2.   Speed up the decision-making timeline.
3.   Expedite your choices.
4.   Decide faster and more efficiently.
5.   Accelerate your ability to make decisions.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000

Or alternatively:
Ideal for brainstorming and solving problems.

72
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Detailed Implementation

In this case, I have adjusted "implementation details" to "Detailed Implementation". This maintains the original meaning but presents it in a clearer and more engaging manner for readers, making it easier for them to understand what the content will cover.

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have the option to customize the location of the chat at all times.

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
In your editing tool.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
In other words, if you wish to view your code, please do so.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Simultaneously share and transfer your project files within the chat.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
1. You may click on the icon located in the secondary sidebar.
2. Click the icon situated within the secondary sidebar.

Please move the conversation to the sidebar by simply dragging it there.

79
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
All conversations are stored in a history.

or

Your chats are archived in a history.

or

A history contains all of your chats.

Each of these versions maintains the original meaning while improving clarity and grammar.

80
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Accessible anytime via the History Icon

or

Anytime Access with the History Icon

Both are clear, grammatically correct, and convey the same meaning as your original text.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
At the peak of the conversation.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You can locate a few additional spots where GitHub Copilot is available.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
"It can also prove quite beneficial."

84
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
One instance occurs when you encounter an issue within your coding.

85
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You will discover GitHub Copilot located within the lightbulb icon here.

86
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Quick Suggestion Menu for Explanation

The revised version aims to clarify the original text by providing a more descriptive title. The key points I addressed include improving clarity and grammar while ensuring that the essence of the original text remains unchanged. Here's a brief explanation of the changes made:

1. Or -> Quick Suggestion Menu for Explanation: Replacing "or" with a more descriptive title helps provide a clearer understanding of what the menu is intended for.
2. it can explain -> explains: Using the verb in its third-person singular form makes the sentence grammatically correct.
3. where -> for explanation: Adding "for" before "explanation" makes the purpose of the quick suggestion menu more explicit.

87
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Correct errors in-line as you go along.

Or, more succinctly: Inline correction of errors.

88
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Copilot Excellently Corrects Ridiculous Errors

Or

Copilot Exceptionally Addresses Foolish Mistakes

Or

Copilot Outstandingly Rectifies Silly Blunders

These options maintain the meaning of the original text but are written in a more formal and clear manner.

You will discover GitHub Copilot in various locations. (or alternatively: You can locate GitHub Copilot in multiple places.)

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Observe the sparkle icon that is visible to you.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
This encompasses locations such as the terminals.

93
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
"In any location where GitHub Copilot can assist you."

94
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
